# Smart DevOps Dashboard - Technical Development Plan

## 1. Overview
The Smart DevOps Dashboard is a cloud-native monitoring platform that aggregates CI/CD build metrics, provides real-time visualization dashboards, and leverages machine learning to predict build failures. It enables teams to monitor pipeline health, identify bottlenecks, and take proactive actions to improve development velocity and reliability.

## 2. Architecture
### Monorepo Layout
- `apps/api/`: FastAPI backend service
- `apps/web/`: Next.js frontend dashboard
- `ml/`: Machine learning prediction service
- `infra/`: Infrastructure as code (Terraform)
- `.github/`: CI/CD workflows and templates

### Tech Stack Summary
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Pydantic v2, SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
- **ML**: scikit-learn, pandas, joblib
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, Terraform, AWS EKS
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Data Flow Diagram
Build tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.) send metrics via REST API to the backend, which stores data in the database. The frontend polls the API for real-time updates and renders charts. The ML service consumes historical metrics to train models and provide failure predictions. Infrastructure components handle container orchestration, monitoring, and scaling.

## 3. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Backend API (âœ… Done)
**Objective**: Implement REST API for metrics ingestion and retrieval.  
**Key Deliverables/Files**: `apps/api/app/main.py`, `models.py`, `schemas.py`, `db.py`, `routes/metrics.py`, `tests/test_metrics.py`, `requirements.txt`, `pytest.ini`.  
**Tools & Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, pytest.  
**Success Criteria**: All pytest tests pass (422 validation, 201 creation, array retrieval).  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week (completed).

### Phase 2: Frontend Dashboard
**Objective**: Build responsive web dashboard for metrics visualization and real-time updates.  
**Key Deliverables/Files**: `apps/web/pages/`, `components/`, `lib/api.ts`, `styles/`, e2e tests.  
**Tools & Dependencies**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Playwright.  
**Success Criteria**: Unit tests pass, Playwright e2e tests validate dashboard interactions.  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks.

### Phase 3: ML Service for Build-Failure Prediction
**Objective**: Develop ML service that analyzes historical metrics to predict build failures.  
**Key Deliverables/Files**: `ml/train.py`, `predict.py`, `models/`, `requirements.txt`, unit tests.  
**Tools & Dependencies**: scikit-learn, pandas, joblib, pytest.  
**Success Criteria**: Model achieves >80% accuracy on test data, API endpoints for training and prediction.  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks.

### Phase 4: Containerization & Local Dev
**Objective**: Dockerize services and set up local development environment with Docker Compose.  
**Key Deliverables/Files**: `Dockerfile` per service, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env` templates.  
**Tools & Dependencies**: Docker, Docker Compose.  
**Success Criteria**: `docker-compose up` runs all services locally, API accessible at localhost.  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week.

### Phase 5: Cloud Infrastructure
**Objective**: Provision cloud infrastructure for staging environment using IaC.  
**Key Deliverables/Files**: `infra/terraform/`, EKS cluster, Prometheus/Grafana setup.  
**Tools & Dependencies**: Terraform, AWS CLI, Helm.  
**Success Criteria**: Staging environment deployed, services accessible via load balancer, monitoring dashboards functional.  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks.

### Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline
**Objective**: Implement automated CI/CD for testing, building, and deploying to production.  
**Key Deliverables/Files**: `.github/workflows/`, deployment scripts.  
**Tools & Dependencies**: GitHub Actions, Docker Hub, AWS CLI.  
**Success Criteria**: PRs trigger tests, merges deploy to staging/prod, rollbacks work.  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks.

## 4. Testing & QA
- **Backend**: pytest for unit/integration tests, focusing on API endpoints, database operations, and validation.
- **Frontend**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for end-to-end tests covering user flows like viewing metrics and predictions.
- **ML**: pytest for model training/validation, accuracy metrics.
- **Automated CI**: GitHub Actions runs full test suite on PRs, including linting, security scans, and integration tests. Manual QA for UI/UX before releases.

## 5. Deployment Strategy
- **Local Development**: Use Docker Compose for isolated service development.
- **Staging**: Terraform provisions EKS cluster with Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.
- **Production**: GitHub Actions CI pipeline builds images, runs tests, and deploys to production EKS via blue-green or rolling updates.
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback to previous stable version on deployment failures.

## 6. Documentation & Maintenance
- **README.md**: Setup instructions, API docs, deployment guides.
- **ASSISTANT_STATE.md**: Tracks project progress, current phase, pending tasks.
- **Inline Docstrings**: All functions/methods have docstrings for maintainability.
- **Updates**: Docs updated after each phase completion, with CHANGELOG.md for releases.

## 7. Task Backlog

| ID | Task | Type | Status | Notes |
|----|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Implement Next.js dashboard layout | feat | todo | Basic responsive layout with navigation |
| 2 | Add Chart.js metrics visualization | feat | todo | Line/bar charts for build duration, coverage |
| 3 | Integrate API calls in frontend | feat | todo | Fetch metrics from backend API |
| 4 | Train initial ML model | feat | todo | Use sample data for failure prediction |
| 5 | Dockerize all services | refactor | todo | Create Dockerfiles and compose file |
| 6 | Set up EKS infrastructure | infra | todo | Terraform for staging cluster |
| 7 | Configure CI pipeline | ci | todo | GitHub Actions for build/test/deploy |

## 8. Assistant Guide
Assistants should generate clear, actionable prompts for Copilot/Grok to implement features. Keep commits atomic (one feature per commit). Run full test suite after each phase. Update ASSISTANT_STATE.md with progress. Use tools for file creation/editing, validate with tests. Prioritize backlog tasks, mark as in-progress when starting, completed when done.

## 9. Continuous Improvement Notes
- Add WebSocket event flow from backend to frontend for real-time chart updates.
- Include static analysis (ruff, mypy, eslint) in CI pipeline.
- Configure Terraform remote state (S3 + DynamoDB lock) before Phase 5 deploys.
- Add image vulnerability scan (Trivy) and dependency alerts.
- Extend observability stack with centralized log collection.
